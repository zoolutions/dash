# dash

**dash** (`zoolutions/dash`) — deploy web apps anywhere. Began as a fork of [basecamp/kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal); made a clean break in 2026-08 (issue #115) and now moves independently — no upstream remote, no sync, no contributions back. Published on rubygems.org as `dash`; the executable is `dash` and the Ruby namespace is `Dash::` (stage 2, issue #117). The server run directory is `.dash/` as of stage 3b; the remaining on-server artifacts (`kamal-proxy` container, `kamal` network, `KAMAL_*` env vars) keep their names until stage 3c ships (see Staged rename below).

## Memory

Durable project memory lives in `lode/` (index: `lode/lode-map.md`). Read it before exploring the code. `lode/review/` holds accepted review findings as rules about the system; `/lode:gate` enforces them before any push, and `/lode:learn` adds to them. `lode/workflow.md` is the profile the shared `/lode:*` workflow skills read.

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby**: 3.2–4.0 (CI matrix), Thor CLI, SSHKit + net-ssh, Zeitwerk
- **Gem**: `dash`, built from `dash.gemspec`
- **Proxy**: ghcr.io/zoolutions/dash-proxy (sibling repo `../kamal-proxy` → `zoolutions/dash-proxy`)
- **Testing**: minitest + mocha; integration tests run real deploys in Docker
- **Linting**: rubocop-rails-omakase

## Critical Rules

### Never Do

1. **NO pushing directly to `main`** — everything lands via PR (ruleset-enforced; admin bypass is for migrations, not routine)
2. **NO upstream syncs** — the fork network is left; basecamp code arrives only by deliberate cherry-pick, never via an `upstream` remote
3. **NO `-suffix` versions** like `v1.0.0-rc1` for the proxy — `Gem::Version` parses `-` as a prerelease, which sorts OLDER than the base and hard-fails `dash proxy boot`
4. **NO gem release before the proxy image exists** — the tag named by `Dash::Configuration::Proxy::Run::MINIMUM_VERSION` must be pullable from `ghcr.io/zoolutions/dash-proxy` first (`rake release` gates on this)
5. **NO `git push --tags`** — single-tag pushes only; `rake release` creates the gem tag via `gh release create`
6. **NO rebasing published branches** — merge forward; history is shared
7. **NO renaming the remaining server artifacts yet** — the `kamal-proxy` container name, the `kamal` docker network, the `kamal-proxy-config` / `kamal-loadbalancer-config` volumes, `KAMAL_*` env vars, and the image title label wait for stage 3c and a coordinated dash-proxy release. The run directory (`.dash/`) and config-digest label landed in 3b.

### Always Do

1. **Branch features off `main`**, PR back into `main`
2. **Interpolate `MINIMUM_VERSION` in test expectations** — never hardcode proxy versions
3. **Run unit tests + rubocop before pushing**; `bin/test` before merging

## Commands

```bash
bin/test                              # Full suite (integration needs Docker + published proxy image)
bundle exec ruby -Itest -e 'Dir["test/**/*_test.rb"].grep_v(/integration/).each { |f| require File.expand_path(f) }'  # Unit tests only
bundle exec rubocop --parallel        # Lint
bin/release [patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z] # Release: previews the bump + changelog, confirms, then runs rake release (`list`, `--dry-run`, `--force`)
rake release[3.2.0]                   # Release (low-level): version bump + tag v3.2.0 + GitHub release; CI trusted-publishes to RubyGems (Sigstore)
rake verify                           # Build the gem and list its contents
bin/sync-proxy-flags                  # Refresh the proxy flag manifest when MINIMUM_VERSION moves
```

## Architecture

```
Layer 5: bin/dash                  (entry point -> Dash::Cli::Main)
Layer 4: Dash::Cli::*             lib/dash/cli (Thor commands, hooks)
Layer 3: Dash::Commander          lib/dash/commander.rb (DASH singleton, target resolution)
Layer 2: Dash::Commands::*        lib/dash/commands (docker command builders)
Layer 1: Dash::Configuration      lib/dash/configuration (deploy.yml -> objects, validation)
Layer 0: SSHKit                    (remote execution)
```

## The mental model

> `main` is the branch; a dash release is `main` plus a published dash-proxy image whose tag equals `MINIMUM_VERSION`. Proxy image first, gem second — always.

## Release flow

1. If the proxy changed or `MINIMUM_VERSION` must move: in `../kamal-proxy`, `script/release-dash v1.0.0.X` → CI publishes `ghcr.io/zoolutions/dash-proxy:v1.0.0.X` (multi-arch, must be PUBLIC); set `MINIMUM_VERSION` here and run `bin/sync-proxy-flags`.
2. `bin/test` (full suite).
3. `bin/release [patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z]` — computes the next version from `lib/dash/version.rb`, shows the commits since the last tag, requires a clean, up-to-date `main`, and asks for confirmation before running `rake release[X.Y.Z]`, which gates on the proxy image, bumps `lib/dash/version.rb` + the `Gemfile.lock` pin, commits, pushes `main`, creates the `vX.Y.Z` GitHub release. The `release.yml` workflow then tests, builds, Sigstore-signs, and trusted-publishes to RubyGems (environment `rubygems`).

Gem tags are plain `vX.Y.Z` (own semver, 3.x line). Historical `dash-v*` tags are frozen. Proxy tags stay `v<base>.<n>` (or plain semver).

## Proxy image contract

- dash reads the running proxy version FROM THE IMAGE TAG (`docker inspect kamal-proxy --format '{{.Config.Image}}'`) and compares it with `Gem::Version` (`Dash::Utils.older_version?`). Only the tag is compared, so old `kamal-proxy`-image containers upgrade cleanly to `dash-proxy` images.
- The image must carry the label `org.opencontainers.image.title=kamal-proxy` — `dash proxy remove` prunes by it (label rename waits for the bridge).
- Defaults live in `lib/dash/configuration/proxy/run.rb` (`MINIMUM_VERSION`, repository `ghcr.io/zoolutions/dash-proxy`) and `lib/dash/configuration/proxy/boot.rb` (legacy boot path).
- The old `ghcr.io/zoolutions/kamal-proxy` package stays published — gem versions < 3.2.0 pull it.

## Staged rename (issue #115 stages 2–3)

| Stage | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | CLI executable + user-facing text + docs (`dash` only) | DONE (3.2.0) |
| 2 | Ruby namespace `Kamal::` → `Dash::`, `lib/kamal` → `lib/dash` | DONE (#117) |
| 3a | Local project directory `.kamal/` → `.dash/`, dual-emitted `DASH_*`/`KAMAL_*` env vars | DONE (#125) |
| 3b | Server run directory `.kamal/` → `.dash/` (self-migrating `mv`), config-digest label `org.kamal.*` → `org.dash.*` (read-both), local registry container | DONE (#123) |
| 3c | `kamal-proxy` container + network + volume names, `org.opencontainers.image.title` — needs a coordinated dash-proxy release | follow-up issue |
| 3d | Drop the read-both fallbacks (`.kamal/` project dir, legacy digest label) | 5.0 |

## Testing

- Unit: everything under `test/` except `test/integration` — genuinely no Docker needed. `test_helper.rb` pins `Dash::Utils.docker_arch` and stubs `Dash::Docker.included_files`, so the suite is green whether or not a daemon is running. The old "two builder tests fail on Apple Silicon" caveat is gone — they were reading the local daemon's architecture.
- Integration: real deploys against Docker-in-Docker VMs; pulls `ghcr.io/zoolutions/dash-proxy:$MINIMUM_VERSION` — the tag must be published or the suite fails.
- CI: rubocop + actionlint/zizmor + Ruby 3.2–4.0 matrix on `main`.
- Multi-host fixtures with a >1-host primary role need `loadbalancer: false` under `proxy:` — the loadbalancer auto-activates and the dind harness can't support it.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/lode:lfg` | Full autonomous workflow: branch off `main` → understand → plan → TDD → verify → gate → PR |
| `/lode:plan` | Read-only planning → a GitHub issue (this repo keeps plans in issues, not in `docs/`) |
| `/lode:tdd` | Enforce RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with Minitest + Mocha |
| `/lode:review-pr` | Full PR pass: resolve conflicts with the base, then CI failures, then review comments |
| `/lode:finish-prs` | Drive a set of open PRs to merge-ready, one at a time, in order |
| `/lode:debug-flaky` | Root-cause an intermittent test failure — evidence → repro → stress-proofed fix; never skip/retry |
| `/lode:gate` | The pre-PR gate: fresh-context review against the rules and `lode/review/`, looping until clean |
| `/lode:learn` | Write accepted review findings into `lode/review/` |
| `/lode:sync` | Keep `lode/` true to the code after a change |
| `/architect` | Coordinate multi-layer work across the Thor CLI → Commander → Commands → Configuration cake |
| `/security` | Audit SSH command construction, secret handling, shell escaping, error-page paths |
| `/perf` | Baseline vs `main` in a worktree — command construction only (dash has no bench suite) |
| `/review-pr` | Local single-pass review against this repo's patterns and constraints |

The `/lode:*` commands come from the `lode@zoolutions` plugin (enabled in `.claude/settings.json`) and read `lode/workflow.md` for everything repo-specific. The four local commands that remain pin a model tier via frontmatter aliases (`sonnet` implementation, `opus` orchestration/security/review) so they track the latest model per tier.

## More Documentation

- `docs/` — the documentation site: a self-contained docs-kit Rails app (own bundle, RSpec, CI job `docs-ci.yml`), deployed to https://dash.zoolutions.llc by `deploy-docs.yml` on each release. The Configuration pages are GENERATED from `lib/dash/configuration/docs/*.yml` (parsed by `docs/app/models/config_doc.rb`); a new doc YAML fails `docs/spec/config_docs_spec.rb` until registered in `docs/app/models/doc.rb`.
- `ROADMAP.md` — evidence-linked improvement roadmap
- `.claude/rules/` — coding-style, git-workflow, testing, agents, performance, striving-for-excellence, upstream-sync (historical)
- `.claude/commands/` — the four local slash commands above; the workflow ones now come from the `lode@zoolutions` plugin
- Proxy repo: `../kamal-proxy/CLAUDE.md` — cross-repo release ordering
- Upstream kamal docs (shared basics): https://kamal-deploy.org
