  def everyday
    DocsUI::Section("Main commands") do
      command_table MAIN
      md <<~'MD'
        `setup` for the first deploy, `deploy` for every one after,
        `rollback` when it goes wrong, `doctor` when you are not sure it will
        go right. `dash docs` prints the same configuration reference the
        [Configuration](/docs/configuration) pages here are generated from.
        `migrate` renames a kamal project's `.kamal/` to `.dash/` — see
        [From kamal](/docs/from-kamal). The `--json` flags and `dash mcp` are
        covered in [Debugging](/docs/debugging).

        `--rolling` on `upgrade`, `proxy reboot`, and `proxy upgrade` walks the
        hosts one at a time instead of in parallel — see
        [Rolling restarts](/docs/worker-roles#rolling-restarts).

  def proxy_commands
    DocsUI::Section("dash proxy", description: "Manage the proxy and its dash-only features.") do
      subcommand_table PROXY
      md <<~'MD'
        The `loadbalancer`, `cache`, `domains`, and `export_certs`/`import_certs`
        commands are dash-only — see [Load balancing](/docs/load-balancing),
        [Response caching](/docs/caching), and
        [SAN batching & wildcards](/docs/certificates).

  def scale_commands

      md <<~'MD'
        The count is in containers across the role's hosts, spread evenly
        within each host's `replicas` bounds, at the version already running.
        It takes the deploy lock, and the next deploy keeps it. dash-only — see
        [Replicas](/docs/worker-roles#replicas).
