# frozen_string_literal: true

# In-memory registry of the reference docs. One line per page — slug and view
# derive from the title (both overridable), and the sidebar nav derives from this
# registry with zero extra code (see config/initializers/docs_kit.rb's
# `nav_registries`). It also feeds the AI surfaces (/llms.txt, /llms-full.txt,
# search, MCP): an unwritten page (whose view class doesn't resolve yet) is
# silently skipped everywhere, so the whole list can be declared up front as a
# burn-down of pages to author.
#
# Add a page with `rails g docs_kit:page "Title" --group=…`, which appends the
# `page` line here and writes the class under app/views/docs/pages/. Uses
# DocsKit::Registry for the shared all/from_slug/grouped/nav_items API.
#
# The Configuration group is GENERATED: one page per commented-YAML doc in
# ../lib/dash/configuration/docs (the same files `dash docs` prints), rendered
# through ConfigDoc + Views::Docs::Pages::ConfigPage. The drift spec
# (spec/config_docs_spec.rb) fails when a doc YAML has no page here or a
# ConfigPage here has no YAML. Hand-written pages may sit in the group too
# (Secrets adapters) — they are not ConfigPages and the spec skips them.
