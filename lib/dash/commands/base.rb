    # Lives on Base because two unlocked paths reach the run directory before
    # Dash::Cli::Base#ensure_run_directory does — the auditor records "Pulled
    # image" during `build:pull`, and every `mkdir -p .dash/...` underneath it
    # creates the parent. If any of them made the directory with a bare mkdir,
    # `.dash` would exist by the time the guard ran and the legacy tree would be
    # stranded. Everything that can be first must run the same command.
    #
    # The migration is safe to repeat on every command:
    #
    # - Idempotent - once `.dash` exists the second guard is false forever.
    # - Atomic - the two are siblings in the SSH user's home, so this is a
    #   rename within one filesystem, never a copy.
    # - Invisible to running containers - a bind mount resolves to an inode,
    #   so the live proxy keeps serving from the renamed directory and only
    #   picks up the new path when it is next recreated.
    #
    # `test` leads deliberately: SSHKit's command map passes `if`/`test`/`time`/
    # `exec` through untouched and prefixes everything else with `/usr/bin/env`.
    # The trailing `|| true` keeps the exit status zero when there is nothing to
    # migrate, since callers execute this with raise_on_non_zero_exit on.
