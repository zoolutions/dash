# Proxy::Run.digest reaches for Digest::SHA256 from inside `on(KAMAL.proxy_hosts)`,
# so the first reference happens in several SSHKit threads at once. Digest defines
# SHA256 lazily — `Digest.const_missing(:SHA256)` runs `require "digest/sha2"`, and
# that path is not mutex-guarded — so the threads race it and one loses with
# "Digest::Base cannot be directly inherited in Ruby", failing `kamal proxy boot`
# on a random host.
#
# Requiring "digest" alone does NOT fix this: it defines the module but leaves
# SHA256 to const_missing. Pull in the implementation itself, before any threads
# exist to race it.
