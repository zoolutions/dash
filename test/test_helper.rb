  # Unit tests must not touch Docker — but two paths did, and both reached a
  # real daemon:
  #
  #   Dash::Utils.docker_arch shells out to `docker info` to learn the host
  #   architecture. Tests derive their expected --platform from it, so the
  #   answer decided whether they passed. On Apple Silicon it returned arm64
  #   against fixtures written for amd64 (the "two known builder failures"), and
  #   with the daemon stopped it returned "" and took five more tests down with
  #   it. That is what made the suite look seed-flaky: it was tracking whether
  #   Docker happened to be running.
  #
  #   Dash::Docker.included_files runs an actual `docker buildx build` over the
  #   repo to list what a build would include. `dash build dev` calls it, so
  #   three CLI tests were building a busybox image on every run.
  #
  # Pin both. amd64 is what CI runs on, so local and CI now agree, and the suite
  # no longer cares whether a daemon is up.

    # `dash app stale_containers --quiet` in test/cli/app_test.rb silences every later
    # SSHKit.config.output.info in the process. Whether that mattered depended on the
